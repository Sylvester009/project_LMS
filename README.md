### Project Overview:
The Library Management System (LMS) will manage the following:
1. **Books**: Adding, removing, and searching for books in the library.
2. **Library Members**: Registering members, and checking their borrowing status.
3. **Borrowing/Returning**: Keeping track of which member has borrowed which book and managing the return process.
4. **Library Inventory**: Managing the stock of books, and possibly tracking how many copies of a book are available.

### Core Features:
- **Adding and Removing Books**: The system should allow adding new books to the library and removing books when needed.
- **Member Registration**: Users must be registered as library members before they can borrow books.
- **Borrowing and Returning**: A system to borrow books, record who borrowed which book, and manage book returns.
- **Search Functionality**: Users should be able to search for books by title, author, or genre.

### Implementation Focus:

- **OOP Principles**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Ensure each class manages its own data and provides necessary methods to interact with it (e.g., a `Book` class should manage book-related functionality).
  - **Abstraction**: Create a clear interface for interacting with the library, books, and members, hiding the implementation details.
  - **Inheritance and Polymorphism** (optional for this level): If you want to extend functionality, consider classes like `DigitalBook` or `EBook`, which might inherit from `Book`.

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one clear responsibility, like the `Library` class for managing books and members, and the `Member` class for handling borrow and return functionality.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: Design your system so that it can be extended (e.g., adding new types of members or books) without changing existing code.
